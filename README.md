Project Status
==============
- SnipText is under ongoing development; build configuration and features will evolve alongside the main README instructions as time allows.

What SnipText Does
===================
- Desktop utility that lets you select an area of the screen, runs Tesseract OCR on the captured pixels, copies the recognized text to the clipboard, and (optionally) saves the screenshot.
- Ships with a minimal Qt Widgets UI: one button to start a capture, overlay color selector, and toggle for saving screenshots.
- Features/UI are still evolving; expect updates as development continues.

Building and Configuration
==========================

Current scope
-------------
- Targets macOS builds only (Qt Widgets app bundled as a .app).
- Uses AppleClang with C++17, Qt5/Qt6 Widgets, and Tesseract OCR + Leptonica.
- Android / Windows / Linux boilerplate generated by Qt remains untouched for now; future work can expand those sections.

Qt configuration
----------------
- CMake expects Qt to be discoverable via `QT_DIR` or `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.
- Example: `cmake -S . -B build -DQT_DIR=/Users/me/Qt/6.6.3/macos/lib/cmake/Qt6`.
- All sources are bundled into `qt_add_executable` (Qt6) or `add_executable` (Qt5).

Tesseract / Leptonica integration
---------------------------------
- Configurable prefixes:
  * `TESSERACT_ROOT` — base prefix containing `include/` and `lib/` for Tesseract (defaults to `/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/local`, `/opt/local`).
  * `TESSDATA_PREFIX` — directory containing `tessdata/` files. Defaults to `${TESSERACT_ROOT}/share/tessdata` (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/share/tessdata`).
- `find_path` and `find_library` locate headers (`tesseract/baseapi.h`) and libs (`tesseract`, `lept`/`leptonica`).
- On failure, configuration stops with guidance to install Tesseract (e.g., `brew install tesseract`) or set `TESSERACT_ROOT`.
- Runtime library paths (RPATHs) are set from the located libraries so macOS’s dynamic loader (dyld) picks them up automatically without extra environment tweaks.
- The resolved tessdata path is baked into the binary via `DEFAULT_TESSDATA_PATH` so OCR init uses that location without editing the source.
  
Runtime behavior tie-ins
------------------------
- `mainwindow.cpp` reads `DEFAULT_TESSDATA_PATH` and passes it to `OcrService::initialize()`.
- If OCR init fails (for example due to a bad tessdata path), the app shows a warning dialog and continues running, but captures won't produce text until it’s fixed.

Future expansion notes
----------------------
- Windows/Linux support would extend `_TESS_SEARCH_PATHS` and add platform-specific logic for library names / RPATH equivalents.

Permissions
-----------
- On macOS, grant SnipText screen-recording permission (System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Screen & System Audio Recording) so the capture overlay works.

Usage recap
-----------
```
mkdir -p build
cmake -S . -B build \
      -DQT_DIR=/path/to/Qt/lib/cmake/Qt6 \
      -DTESSERACT_ROOT=/opt/homebrew \
      -DTESSDATA_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew/share/tessdata
cmake --build build
```

Adjust the prefixes to match your environment; once `CMakeCache.txt` exists you can run `cmake -LH build` to review/edit cached values.
